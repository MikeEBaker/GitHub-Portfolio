  <p>Hi, I'm Mike.<br> I am currently learning full stack development with the MERN stack.<br>
     So far, CSS and user experience have been my favorite areas. Front end development has<br>
     been gratifying and I'm excited to dive into the back end. Please take a look around,<br>
     reach out if there is anything I can do for you.

  <h2>Here are some projects I've done.</h2>
